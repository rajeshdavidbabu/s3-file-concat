## Why?  

If you are already using **S3**, you would know that the files are immutable in S3. Meaning you cannot edit or modify the contents of a file. Instead, you can only create a new one. Out of its many use-cases, S3 is prevalently used for dumping small to large data files/logs. ***Let's assume that you want to append all the data files inside a folder into one file, you cannot do it with an S3 API.*** That's where this minimal library comes into the picture.  
  

## Files ?? What kind of files can you append/concatenate?  

This can append all the text-based files that support **utf-8 format** and also **JSON** files.  
  

- .doc/.docx  
- .csv/.xls/.xslx  
- .txt/plain  
- .json  
  

## How does it handle different data-types?  

The library makes use of **JSON.parse API**, which would parse all object based data-types and throws for strings. The data returned from the api is sanitized, and the output is either concatenated or merged.

- Files containing large lists of strings/number/utf8 char codes are  
***concatenated***.  
- Files containing large arrays (of strings and objects) are  
***concatenated*** into one file consisting of the concatenated array.  
- Files containing objects are the only exception here. Pure objects are  
***merged*** instead (the last file overrides all the other keys).  
  

**Important Note:**  *Merging two files of different data-types will result in an error. Eg: you cannot merge a file containing a string and a file containing an object.*  
  

## Requirments  

- Node version (8.9.1) and above.  
- AWS-SDK.  
  

## Installation  
  
  

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install dependencies.  
  

```bash  
npm  install  s3-file-concat --save  
```  
  

## Usage  
  

```javascript  
const  S3FileConcat  =  require('s3-file-concat');  
  
// this libray uses factory function composition against using classes for better encapsulation.  
// so its free from using `new` and `this` :)  
  
const  {  concatFiles  }  =  S3FileConcat({  
  "accessKeyId":  "<your AWS access key>",  
  "secretAccessKey":  "<your secret key>",  
  "region":  "<your region>",  
  "bucket":  "<your bucket>"  
});  
  
/** concatFiles method accepts two arguments and returns a promise.  
1) Keys of the S3 files we want to concatenate/append/merge.  
2) Options (optional object):  
i) targetFileKey: "<mybucket/myfolder/myConcatendatedFile>"
ii) deleteSourceFiles: '<true or false>' // defaulted to false.  
*/

// Appending arrays files
let keys = [
  'testdata/arrays/array1.json',
  'testdata/arrays/array2.json',
  'testdata/arrays/array3.json'
];
// this creates a new file on s3 with appended content.
let targetFileKey = 'testdata/arrays/array_append.json';

// Appending CSV files
keys = [
  'testdata/csv_files/csv1.csv',
  'testdata/csv_files/csv2.csv',
  'testdata/csv_files/csv3.csv'
];
targetFileKey = 'testdata/csv_files/csv_append.csv';

// Appending doc files
keys = [
  'testdata/doc_files/doc1.doc',
  'testdata/doc_files/doc2.doc',
  'testdata/doc_files/doc3.doc'
];
targetFileKey = 'testdata/doc_files/doc_append.doc';

// Merging objects files
keys = [
  'testdata/objects/object1.json',
  'testdata/objects/object2.json',
  'testdata/objects/object3.json'
];
targetFileKey = 'testdata/objects/object_append.json';

// Appending plain files
keys = [
  'testdata/plain/plain1',
  'testdata/plain/plain2',
  'testdata/plain/plain3'
];
targetFileKey = 'testdata/plain/plain_append';

// Appending txt files
keys = [
  'testdata/txt_files/file1.txt',
  'testdata/txt_files/file2.txt',
  'testdata/txt_files/file3.txt',
  'testdata/txt_files/file4.txt'
];
targetFileKey = 'testdata/txt_files/file_append.txt';
  
// Note: when targetFileKey is empty, then we assume that 
// the user wants to use the appended/merged data and 
// return him appended/merged data in the promise resolve.  
  
s3FileConcat.concatFiles(keys,  {  
  targetFileKey  
})
// when no options are passed output consists of the appended
// file contents, sometimes a  huge dataset waiting to be used.  
.then(output  =>  console.log('All done ',  output)) 
.catch(error  =>  console.log('error occured oops ',  error));  
```  
  

*P.S: If the readbility is not great, please check the [example](https://github.com/rajeshdavidbabu/s3-file-concat/tree/master/example) folder.*  
  

## Example Usage  

If the usage above is not clear, fear not. I have made a detailed usage scenario with different file types. [Here](https://github.com/rajeshdavidbabu/s3-file-concat/tree/master/example) you will find how you can pass options pass and the s3 file Keys in detail for all the file most common file types including arrays, objects and text files.
  

## Testing  

Currently, the testing setup is still pending, but as part of the manual testing process for different file types have been tested with the following test data present inside the examples folder. The test data consists of the the known possible file types user would like to append/concatenate/merge, the resulting appended file is also part of it.
  

This is my test data and the library handled. However, if you are really interested in testing its behaviour. Upload the [s3BucketTestFiles](https://github.com/rajeshdavidbabu/s3-file-concat/tree/master/example/s3BucketTestFiles) to your target bucket and run the [example/index.js](https://github.com/rajeshdavidbabu/s3-file-concat/blob/master/example/index.js) with valid aws config. Be sure to read the code comments there !!
